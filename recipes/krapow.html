    <h2>Minced Pork with Egg, Rice, and Holy Basil</h2>
    <p>Most of the street vendors around Thailand will serve krapao as it is a very popular lunchtime dish - 
        indeed it is a joke in many offices when you don't know what to order for lunch, you just order krapao.</p>
        <p>This dish is also quick and delicious to make at home - the only ingredient you may struggle to find outside of Asia
         is holy basil - at a push you could use sweet basil instead. Pad krapao is usually made using either chicken or pork, 
         but beef or even seafood like squid could also be used:</p>
         <h2>Ingredients</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 shallots </li>
            <li>7 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fish oil</li>
            <li>holy basil leaves</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons dark soy sauce</li>
            <li>â…“ cup low sodium chicken broth or water</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons oyster sauce</li>
            <li>3 Thai bird or holland chilies </li>
         </ul>
         <h2>Steps</h2>
         <ol>
            <li>In a wok over medium high heat, add the oil, shallots and garlic, and fry for 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the chilies and cook for another minute. Crank up the heat to high, and add the ground pork, 
                breaking it up into small bits and
                allowing it to crisp up.</li>
                <li>Add the sugar, fish sauce, soy sauce, dark soy sauce, and oyster sauce. </li>
                <li>Stir-fry for another minute and deglaze the pan with the broth or water.
                 Because your pan is over high heat, the liquid should cook off very quickly.</li>
                 <li>Add the basil, and stir-fry until wilted.</li>
                 <li>Serve over rice.</li>
         </ol>
