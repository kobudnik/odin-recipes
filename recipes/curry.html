    <img src="../curry.jpeg" width="450" height="450" alt="Thai Red Curry in a Bowl">
    <p>Red Curry is a popular Thai dish consisting of red curry paste cooked in coconut milk with meat added, 
        such as chicken, beef, pork, duck or shrimp, or vegetarian protein source such as tofu. The base 
        Thai Red Curry paste  traditionally made with a mortar and pestle, and remains moist throughout 
        the preparation process. The red coloring derived from dry red spur chillies. </p>

    <li>1 yellow, orange or green bell pepper, sliced into thin 2-inch long strips</li>
    <li>3 carrots, peeled and sliced on the diagonal into ¼-inch thick rounds (about 1 cup)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons Thai red curry paste</li>
    <li>1 can (14 ounces) regular coconut milk**</li>
    <li>½ cup water</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups packed thinly sliced kale (tough ribs removed first), preferably the Tuscan/lacinato/dinosaur variety</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons coconut sugar or turbinado (raw) sugar or brown sugar</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon tamari or soy sauce***</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons rice vinegar or fresh lime juice</li>
    <li>Garnishes/sides: handful of chopped fresh basil or cilantro, optional red pepper flakes, optional sriracha or chili garlic sauce</li>
</ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to boil. </li>
        <li>Add the rinsed rice and continue boiling for 30 minutes, reducing heat as necessary to prevent overflow. </li>
        <li> Remove from heat, drain the rice and return the rice to pot.</li>
        <li> Cover and let the rice rest for 10 minutes or longer, until you're ready to serve.</li>
        <li>Just before serving, season the rice to taste with salt and fluff it with a fork.</li>
        <li>To make the curry, warm a large skillet with deep sides over medium heat. Once it's hot, add the oil.</li>
        <li>dd the onion and a sprinkle of salt and cook, stirring often, 
            until the onion has softened and is turning translucent, about 5 minutes. </li>
            <li>Add the ginger and garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds, while stirring continuously.</li>
            <li>Add the bell peppers and carrots. Cook until the bell peppers are fork-tender, 3 to 5 more minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Then add the curry paste and cook, stirring often, for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the coconut milk, water, kale and sugar, and stir to combine. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce heat.</li>
            <li>Remove the pot from the heat and season with tamari and rice vinegar.</li>
            <li>Add salt (I added ¼ teaspoon for optimal flavor), to taste.</li>
    </ol>
