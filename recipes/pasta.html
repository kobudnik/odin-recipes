    <img src="../fettucine.jpeg" width="350" height="350" alt="Fettucine Alfredo">
    <p>Fettucine Alfredo is an Italian pasta dish of fresh fettuccine tossed with butter and Parmesan cheese.
        As the cheese melts, it emulsifies the liquids to form a smooth and rich cheese sauce coating the pasta.
        The dish is named after Alfredo di Lelio, who featured the dish at his restaurant in Rome in the early to mid-20th century; 
        the "ceremony" of preparing it tableside was an integral part of the dish.
